# HARE
Hare is a infinite runner made by me and a friend in 2017. It was featured on newgrounds in 10/2017 and sold a little bit on steam. It is localized to portuguese and english, features 5 different stages and 5 bosses. I myself think it's somewhat fun (though it's not a great game). You can find it here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/681290/Hare/. And you can freely play it here: https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/699888.

After a couple of years I decided to release it's source code just so people can play, test and maybe learn how to (or not to) make a game from it's code. It was made using the Game Maker Studio 1.4 engine in my spare time.

# Running the project
You will need:
1. Windows [XP..10]
2. Game Maker: Studio 1.4
3. Patience to read bad coding

Just install GMS1.4, import the Hare.project.gmx to gms1.4. With GMS open you can edit the project and test the game just by pressing F5.
